          The lab though in its early years of establishment has done significant
          work in studying natural compounds with anti-angiogenic efficacies. The
          laboratory has established good in vitro, in vivo and ex-vivo model
          systems to study modulation of tumor angiogenesis by these plant
          compounds.

          including mitogenic, and cell survival signaling, apoptosis and DNA
          damage/repair due to exposure to environmental carcinogens, including
          insecticides, pesticides and UV radiation. The lab is actively exploring
          the molecular and biological effects of microgravity on cells and animal
